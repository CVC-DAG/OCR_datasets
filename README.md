# Common OCR Dataloaders

I created a collection of dataloaders for _recognition_ task. Although detection should be easily implemented, this dataloaders only incorporate recognition (it's free, don't complain).
For internal CVC distribution only amolina@cvc.uab.cat has the original .zip file containing all the data weakly curated.

Make sure to read Terms and Conditions for each dataset before using it.
